# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! A few guidelines to make contributions smooth:

- Fork the repository and create a branch for your change (e.g., `feature/your-feature`).
- Open a pull request against `main` with a clear title and description of the change.
- Keep changes small and focused; add tests for bug fixes and features.
- Ensure `pytest` passes locally before opening a PR.
- Be responsive to review feedback; maintainers may request changes.

If your change is large or architectural, please open an issue first to discuss.
